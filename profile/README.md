`herdstat` is a tool for analyzing and visualizing metrics of Open Source projects hosted on GitHub. As of today its
functionality is limited to generate GitHub-style contribution graphs for individual repository or complete GitHub
organisations.

## `herdstat` Contribution Graph

The `herdstat`-generated contribution graph for the [herdstat organization](https://github.com/herdstat) looks like
this:

## Namesake

`herdstat` is composed of the words _herd_, which means a group of people who usually have a common bond, and _stat_,
which is a well-known Linux command line utility that displays detailed information about files. So replacing _file_
with _open source community_ (= _herd_) does the trick in understanding why we have chosen that name.
